        <h2>About Me.</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Jonathan Garcia. I was born on Fort Bragg in Fayetteville, NC, but shortly moved to Queens, New York. I spent the majority of my 
            child hood in New York, up until the age of 12. It was then that I moved back down to North Carolina, but Charlotte this time. 
            I attended East Mecklenburg High School, and passed with an average academic record. At the time, my high school didn't provide IT courses 
            of any kind, so I wouldn't figure out my love for the technology field until later. I graduated high school in 2011 and proceeded to attend 
            Central Piedmont Community College for two years under the Associates in Science - Computer Science program. Unfortunately, I did not pursue
            anything in that field afterwards, but decided to get a retail job at Harris Teeter. After 2 years there, I would spend the rest of my young
            adult life bouncing between different blue-collar jobs, such as random warehouse positions, a couple of delivery driver positions at Fed-Ex,
            and a decently long stint for the United States Postal Service. I met my would be wife in the year of 2016, and we proceeded to date until an
            unexpected event. In the year of 2020, my son, Sabin Jecht Garcia, was born. This beautiful but definitely surprising day would forever change my
            perspective on my future work life. For nearly the past decade, I had been spending most of my time just working jobs, but never landing a career
            position. It was after I had a son that I really decided to change my life, so in the year 2022, I decided to attend a Coding Bootcamp. *to be continued*
